In the prior lab, we used numpy's `convolve` function, which does the convolution in the time domain. In the time domain, it is a sum of the product of the two signals just for one delay value. Thus this sum of the product must be calculated for each delay. In the frequency domain, the full convolution is computed with a single product. But for the frequency domain convolution method we need to add the computation of the Fourier transforms of both signals, and the inverse Fourier transform of the product. Still, the frequency domain method is faster for our case."
