# OFDM RX Tutorial

This is a stand-alone tutorial on how to build a software receiver to receive an OFDM packet. I present students with a lecture on this topic, including:
1. Video on ["What is OFDM? Subcarriers Shift and Pulse Shape"](https://youtu.be/JGgcD7Js0zs). (5:28)
2. Video on ["How OFDM Got its FFT"](https://youtu.be/f4dXe1G23cc). (8:55)
3. [Slides on the motivation for OFDM](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vlLz7Jt1ZS7oXk04lDIqZTzUZPoXOwMJhXYehtrbpqk/edit?usp=sharing), to explain how and why it works.

To do the tutorial, please open the file, `OFDM_RX_Tutorial.ipynb` in your own Jupyter notebook, or [open it on Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1v4l2ti4gKOtapluisdNeyBN4ZqvQIA2o?usp=sharing). The notebook provides step-by-step instructions to complete the OFDM receiver code and to answer the questions. If you're doing this for a class assignment, you can print your completed notebook as a PDF or ipynb file and submit it.
